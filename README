Badgame 2 is a collection of modifications to Simple Machines Forum 1.1.16 designed 
to address annoying behaviour in vanilla SMF, as well as add a few modern tweaks 
and community-driven features.

Badgame 2 should be installed on top of a fresh SMF 1.1.16 installation, 
replacing the Sources/ and Themes/ directories. The shell script in the SQL folder 
should then be run - this then sets about creating and modifying database tables.
